Negotiators appear close to sealing Gaza ceasefire deal 

DOHA/CAIRO/JERUSALEM, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Negotiators in Qatar appeared close to sealing a deal on Wednesday for a ceasefire in the war in Gaza between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas after 15 months of death and destruction. 

Hamas had given verbal approval to the ceasefire and hostage return proposal under negotiation in Qatar and was waiting for more information to give final written approval, a Palestinian official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. 

A Hamas official who declined to be named also said that the group had not yet given a written response to the proposal. 

Earlier, an Israeli official said Hamas had agreed to the proposal shared by Qatari negotiators. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said shortly afterward that Hamas had not yet given a response. 

Officials from mediators Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. as well as Israel and Hamas said on Tuesday an agreement was closer than ever for a truce in the besieged enclave, the release of hostages held there, and the freeing of Palestinian prisoners detained in Israel. 

A Palestinian official close to the talks said on Wednesday: "I am hopeful a deal can be signed tonight, latest tomorrow." 

A senior Hamas official had told Reuters late on Tuesday it had not yet delivered its response because it was still waiting for Israel to submit maps showing how its forces would withdraw from Gaza. 

During months of on-off talks, the warring sides have previously said they were close to a ceasefire only to hit last-minute obstacles. The broad outlines of the current deal have been in place since mid-2024.
